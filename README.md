# BioUtils

This repo contains various bioinformatics utilities.
It is currently under development.

To use it I have built a CLI:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Egeyae/BioUtils
cd BioUtils
python3 cli.py -h
```

General usage is: `python3 cli.py <tool> [tool options]`


### Installation

Here we detail how to install the tool as a system-wide tool

On Linux:
```shell
sudo ./install.sh
```
sudo is required to create a wrapper in /usr/local/bin/
